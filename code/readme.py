# INDIVIDUALS UPDATE STRATEGIES

        # w/probability mu, someone invents a new strategy;else can "learn"
        # (imitate) strategy from randomly chosen role model, w/probability
        # determined by selection pressure & relative strategy performance

# with probability mu, invent:
# someone switches to a new invented strategy (add it to s_active etc)
            # choose strategy that lost adherent (decrase freq by 1 or delete etc)
